1,8/15/2018,2018,seacoast,SPECIES RELOCATION,DURHAM-1,durham-1,Populations now thriving&#44 Mississippi kites first observed in Durham near here by local bird watchers.,observed,"As temperatures rise due to climate change, we expect to see increasing numbers of wildlife species that are typically located in more southern regions. Sightings of rare birds, which include the sandhill crane and wood stork, have become more and more common. We are also seeing dwindling numbers of some of our historically common native birds, as well as changes in the timing of migration and breeding patterns in some species. The Mississippi kite, a relative newcomer, was first observed nesting in Durham in 2018. ",,,
2,10/30/2020,2020,seacoast,BRIDGE ELEVATED,DURHAM-6,durham-6,Route 4 bridge elevated&#44 enabling migration of salt marsh along Bunker Creek due to sea level rise.,migration,"Salt marshes provide important habitat for wildlife and offer numerous benefits for people, too, such as storing flood water and absorbing wave energy during storms. In Durham, there are roughly 150 acres of existing salt marsh. Unfortunately, these important ecosystems are threatened by rising seas. In coastal NH, sea-level is likely to rise between 0.5 – 1.3  feet by 2050 and between 1.0 – 2.9 feet by 2100 if global greenhouse gas concentrations stabilize; however, there is a risk of much greater sea-level rise if global greenhouse gas concentrations continue to grow and the rate of ice mass loss from Antarctica accelerates rapidly.1 As sea levels rise, salt marshes will migrate upland if they can, or they’ll be lost if they don’t have room to move. In some cases, the topography is too steep to allow gradual salt marsh migration. In other cases, there is a barrier to migration, such as a road, undersized culvert, or retaining wall that causes the marsh to get ‘squeezed out.’ According to marsh migration models, opportunities for salt marsh migration in Durham include areas adjacent to the Oyster River and Little Bay. Durham, in conjunction with the NH Department of Transportation, is incorporating these projections into the design of the Route 4 bridge replacement to allow salt marsh habitat to persist in the face of rising seas, maintaining the many benefits these ecosystems provide and helping to prevent future flooding issues.","(1) Wake, C., Knott, J., Lippmann, T., Stampone, M., Ballestero, T., Bjerklie, D., Burakowski, E., Glidden, S., Hosseini-Shakib, I., Jacobs, J.

3,5/30/2026,2026,seacoast,TREES PROVIDE RELIEF,DURHAM-9,durham-9,Now reducing urban heat effect&#44 elm trees planted along Main Street and Madbury Road.,urban heat effect,"Scientists expect both average and extreme temperatures to rise, not just in degrees, but also in frequency and duration. By 2050, the number of days reaching temperatures of 90ºF or above in Strafford County is projected to increase from 8 to 35 days a year, and over 60 by 2100 if we do nothing to reduce emissions.1 Rising temperatures pose numerous health and safety risks, including exhaustion, dehydration, heat stroke, and dangers associated with ozone. Youth and elderly populations and those with pre-existing health issues are especially vulnerable. In addition, extreme heat raises electricity usage (and associated expenses and greenhouse gas emissions) as more people use air conditioners for longer periods. This is especially pronounced in more developed areas due to the urban heat island effect, where the abundance of pavement and general lack of shade-providing vegetation cause locally higher temperatures than more rural surroundings. One of the best ways to mitigate the urban heat effect is to plant trees, such as elms.",(1) Union of Concerned Scientists. 2019.

5,9/24/2032,2032,seacoast,STORM SURGE DESTRUCTION,DURHAM-5,durham-5,UNH boathouse destroyed by storm surge during a Category 4 hurricane.,storm surge,"While the science connecting climate change to extreme storm intensity is relatively new, there is a strong correlation between sea surface temperatures and increased hurricane activity in the North Atlantic. Globally, the oceans have absorbed over 90% of excess heat caused by greenhouse gas-induced warming since the mid-1900s, and sea surface temperatures are projected to continue increasing.1 The 2017 Atlantic hurricane season was hyperactive, featuring 17 named storms (tied with 1936 as the fifth-most active season since reliable records began in 1851), three of which were major hurricanes that destroyed parts of Texas, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The 2018 hurricane season produced 15 named storms, two of which were category 4 storms and produced catastrophic damage in the Carolinas and the Florida Panhandle. It is likely that the northeast will be impacted by more extreme weather like hurricanes, so we will need to prepare to endure and recover from these storm impacts more frequently.  In addition, the same size storm of today will have greater impacts in the future since it will be occurring on top of sea-level rise. The Town of Durham is proactively incorporating Advisory Climate Change Risk Areas in its Flood Hazard Overlay District, recommending that development in areas vulnerable to future sea-level rise follow best practices today, such as elevating to reduce future flood impacts.

Route 108 is a major commuter corridor and an evacuation route, so this is of particular concern.

In 2011, Durham became the first jurisdiction in the country to adopt the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2012 building energy codes.  Moving forward, the town has committed to basing its energy code on the current printed edition of the IECC, which is now the 2018 version. In 2012 the town completed an energy audit of town-owned facilities. So far, there are solar installations at the police station, the public library, and the Churchill Rink. The new town hall is designed to LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, adding to two LEED certified buildings on the UNH campus. Durham adopted an energy chapter of the master plan in 2015 (see footnotes (1)), which sets a series of goals and recommendations for achieving a more resilient, efficient, and environmentally responsible community. In 2018, the town hosted a fellow from the UNH Sustainability Institute to develop a joint climate resiliency plan.

This may lead to increases in vector-borne diseases including babesiosis, ehrlichiosis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, anaplasmosis, southern tick-associated rash illness, tularemia, and Lyme. One study project that by mid- to late-century (under a high emissions scenario), the period of higher Lyme transmission risk will begin about 1.5 weeks earlier in the northeast compared to the 1990s-2000s.2 We are already experiencing major changes. The number of New Hampshire residents diagnosed with Lyme disease has increased significantly since 2005. From 2009 to 2013, reported cases of Lyme disease in New Hampshire increased by approximately 20 percent, from 1,416 to 1,691 cases per year. 3 This is a major concern from a public health standpoint, and also for our wildlife species like the moose, which are already being significantly impacted by ticks.

Warmer temperatures mean more evaporation and more moisture in the atmosphere, so we are getting more intense rain storms. Also, more of our winter precipitation is falling as rain rather than snow. These patterns are projected to continue to increase, and we will likely see more frequent and intense freshwater flooding events.1 Pettee Brook had been named for a former professor who was instrumental in the relocation of the university from Hanover to Durham in 1890-1893.

The Town Landing parking lot and surrounding upland already see a fair amount of flooding during king tides.

This is not an easy decision but at some point, for specific property owners, the costs to rebuild may exceed the benefits of staying in place. Some communities around the country are implementing voluntary buy-out programs to convert homes that have been damaged by repeated flooding into open space, rather than encouraging people to remain in harm’s way. These newly converted open lands then serve as a buffer for flooding and storms, protecting the people and infrastructure further inland.",,,
