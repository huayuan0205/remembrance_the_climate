Monroe Street Flood",3-Monroe Street Flood,FLASH FLOOD,"Rain and tide combined to create intense downtown flash flood, pushing vehicles onto Munroe Street sidewalks.",,"More than three inches of rain fell in downtown Lynn within a two-hour period. The combination of high tide and torrential rain led to flash floods across North Shore communities, hitting parts of Lynn particularly hard. The downpour flooded Munroe Street and shoved parked vehicles onto sidewalks and against the sides of buildings. A 2023 MAPC analysis of a similar 2010 storm found that most flooding in the region occurred outside of FEMA’s Special Flood Hazard Areas and that many more locations would be vulnerable in the future as the frequency and intensity of rainstorms increases due to climate change.","Storm brings flash flooding in Lynn (wcvb.com). https://www.wcvb.com/article/storm-brings-flash-flooding-in-lynn/12664619
