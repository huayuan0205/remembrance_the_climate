    "more_text": "It was not uncommon for disease to spread during the winter in the New England area, especially around the communities in Essex County. Typhoid fever, or “winter cholera,” could be transmitted through infected food and water. In 1893 Typhoid infections reached an epidemic level. This prompted an investigation of Newburyport’s privately owned water company, Newport Water Company Investigators discovered that Newburyport Water had been tapping the then polluted Merrimack River due to a shortage of water supply from wells and springs, including Bartlett Spring. To quickly solve this issue, the state authorized Newburyport to tap the Artichoke River. Newburyport borders the Artichoke with West Newbury, which led to town water rights being the subject of ongoing conversations. This contentious water rights relationship was noted in the 2020 Newburyport Climate Resiliency Plan, which will hopefully encourage future collaboration between the two towns to protect the vital resource.",

With increased tidal levels and extreme weather due to climate change, flooding began to occur more frequently in coastal towns such as Newburyport (2). When astronomical high tides coincide with multi-day storm events, oceanic storm surge causes sea level to rise above the river which, consequently, prevents the river from discharging. As sea levels continued to rise throughout the 21st century, the risk of inundation continued to increase.",
