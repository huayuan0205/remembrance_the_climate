With increased tidal levels and extreme weather due to climate change, flooding began to occur more frequently in coastal towns such as Newburyport (2). When astronomical high tides coincide with multi-day storm events, oceanic storm surge causes sea level to rise above the river which, consequently, prevents the river from discharging. As sea levels continued to rise throughout the 21st century, the risk of inundation continued to increase.",
