1,essex,1/4/18,2018,JAN 4,ROADWAY UNDER WATER,Essex 2,2,Storm surge flooding closes Main Street.,,"Main Street had historically been subject to frequent flooding caused by extreme high tides and medium to severe storm events. In 2011, construction was completed that raised the road 8 inches, the maximum height possible while maintaining ingress and egress to businesses with adjoining driveways and parking lots. Tide flaps were also installed to help further reduce flooding. These efforts reduced the frequency of flooding however, the causeway is still subject to overtopping multiple times a year. When the road is impassable, traffic is diverted to Apple Street.","(1) Greenbelt, Sea Level Rise and Coastal Flooding in Essex County

2,essex,7/30/25,2025,JUL 30,FLOOD RISK REDUCED,Essex 6,6,Apple Street roadbed elevated out of coastal storm surge zone and culvert replaced with box bridge meeting Massachusetts Stream Crossing Standards to prevent chronic climate related overflow and to restore the ecological transition between wetlands on one side and an upland stream on the other side.,,"The Southern Avenue end of Apple Street was identified as being at a high level of risk due to its sensitivity and exposure to climate-induced flooding caused by astronomical high tides, coastal storm surges, and precipitation events of increased intensity, duration and frequency (1). The Western Avenue end of Apple Street was also identified at high level of risk during extreme precipitation events. With streams passing under it at each end, the street was doubly vulnerable to climate change. Increasing the capacity of the Southern Avenue end stream crossing helped ensure that Apple Street maintained its critical role as an alternate route when Main Street was overtopped by storm surge. Working to keep the Alewife Brook on the Western Avenue end free of debris and excessive plant growth helped keep the brook from overtopping the bridge. Ecological values were restored concurrently on both ends.","(1) National Wildlife Federation, Great Marsh Coastal Adaptation Plan (2017), p 113, 201

3,essex,6/30/34,2034,JUN 30,RELIEVING HIGHER TIDES,Essex 4,4,Ebben Creek culvert enlarged to accommodate tidal flow from sea-level rise.,,"Ebben Creek was long subject to changing tidal patterns as sea levels rose. No longer able to accommodate more intense storms and higher tides, water flowed through the culvert at an abnormally high velocity, threatening the stability of the roadway. Enlarging the culvert enabled greater tidal flow, improving the resiliency of the surrounding marsh.","National Wildlife Federation, Great Marsh Coastal Adaptation Plan (2017), p 114, 117, 169

4,essex,9/30/57,2057,SEP 30,ROADWAY RAISED,Essex 3,3,Causeway elevated 5 feet to keep above continuing sea-level rise.,,"A slightly less than a mile section of Route 133/Main Street, the causeway has long been a vital traffic conduit and by the early 21st century was traversed by 16,000 vehicles daily. Despite being raised 8 inches in 2011, continued sea-level rise (1) and increasingly frequent storm surges caused the tidal flaps at the causeway to close for unprecedented periods of time. More importantly, sea-level rise and storm surge flooding damaged infrastructure and threatened the causeway’s essential public safety role in town and as a connector of Cape Ann to north shore communities (2).","(1) NOAA, Climate Change: Global Sea Level (2022)

5,essex,8/29/61,2061,AUG 29,SPECIES RELOCATES NORTHWARD,Essex 1,1,Last sighting in Essex of the American Bittern,,"The Great Marsh, which covers 22% of the town, is designated as an Important Bird Area of global significance and a Western Hemisphere Shorebird Reserve Network site. The American Bittern once migrated to Massachusetts marshes every April to reproduce (1). It now travels farther north in search of cooler summer temperatures. The attraction of tourists to the marsh and its species is threatened as various bird, plant, and insect species continue to shift north in response to a warming climate (2).","(1) American Bittern Fact Sheet.

6,essex,3/1/74,2074,MAR 1,BRIDGE REPLACES ROAD,Essex 5,5,Bridge connecting Conomo Point to mainland first opened to traffic.,,"As sea-level rise progressed Conomo Point Road was frequently inundated by storm surge-induced flooding events (1). Storms flooded the road at levels higher than an inconvenience reaching 5-20 feet of water (2). As the only route connecting the point to the mainland, residents were no longer able to access basic living and safety necessities. In effect the peninsula was becoming an island.","(1) National Wildlife Federation, Great Marsh Coastal Adaptation Plan (2017), p 116
