In 2011, construction was completed that raised the road 8 inches, the maximum height possible while maintaining ingress and egress to businesses with adjoining driveways and parking lots. Tide flaps were also installed to help further reduce flooding. These efforts reduced the frequency of flooding however, the causeway is still subject to overtopping multiple times a year. When the road is impassable, traffic is diverted to Apple Street.",

   "more_text": "The Southern Avenue end of Apple Street was identified as being at a high level of risk due to its sensitivity and exposure to climate-induced flooding caused by astronomical high tides, coastal storm surges, and precipitation events of increased intensity, duration and frequency (1). The Western Avenue end of Apple Street was also identified at high level of risk during extreme precipitation events. With streams passing under it at each end, the street was doubly vulnerable to climate change. Increasing the capacity of the Southern Avenue end stream crossing helped ensure that Apple Street maintained its critical role as an alternate route when Main Street was overtopped by storm surge. Working to keep the Alewife Brook on the Western Avenue end free of debris and excessive plant growth helped keep the brook from overtopping the bridge. This restored the ecological transition between wetlands on one side and an upland stream on the other side.",
