As a result of this continued flooding, the Cedar Point trail was deemed unsafe, and closed to foot traffic. The area began to convert back to salt marsh, as the ecosystem had more room to migrate without the barrier of the road.","1) State of the Coast: Marsh Migration map using Sea Level Rise Affecting Marshes Model. https://www.onthecoast.thetrustees.org/maps-2

3,,2024,Dec,,TRUSTEES-2,2,ACCESS EXTENDED,Argilla Road culvert enlarged to accommodate increased tidal flow from sea level rise.,,"The only way for vehicles to pass in and out of Crane Beach, Argilla Road, increasingly experienced flooding to the extent that access was blocked for well over an hour at a time. This occurred not only during storms, but also during certain high tides, a phenomenon which increased substantially in the early 21st century until it became a regular tidal occurrence. Raising the road surface provided an opportunity to benefit the health of the marsh by improving tidewater flow that runs under it through a culvert. The installation of a larger culvert enabled more tidewater to reach the upper marsh, reducing the amount of invasive Phragmites and expanding habitat of the endangered salt marsh sparrow.

As a part of the Great Marsh Restoration Project, the Trustees implemented the nature-based restoration method “ditch remediation” on substantial acreage in several area towns. Piloted by the USFWS at the Parker River Wildlife Refuge, this innovative restoration technique successfully restored the natural flooding and draining of the marsh after centuries of alterations from agriculture and mosquito control, allowing the marsh to build peat naturally, and keep pace with SLR. This work strengthened the resiliency of the salt marsh and the many ecosystem services it provides including opportunity for wildlife observation.","1) Protecting Saltmarsh Sparrows.

10,,2059,Feb,,TRUSTEES-7,7,INVASION MIGRATION,"Phragmites, an invasive plant once dominating this area, migrates inland due to saltwater flooding.",,"Phragmites, the common reed, often moves in and takes over areas that have been disturbed, such as roadside edges, drainage ditches, dikes, undersized culverts, and areas with high nutrient loads. It is often indicative of habitat that is out of balance because the Phragmites outcompetes native plants for space. Along the salt marsh, Phragmites invades the edges where it has access to freshwater seepage, which allows it to grow and outcompete native salt marsh plants. While Phragmites can tolerate some salinity, it cannot withstand frequent saltwater inundation. Restoring tidal flow where it is restricted is a restoration technique commonly used to control Phragmites. Similarly, as sea levels rose, and this area received greater tidal flow and Phragmites died back, thus restoring a more balanced plant community.	""1) State of the Coast: Projected Flooding.
