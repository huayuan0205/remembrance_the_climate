The area around Salem State’s Marsh Hall is vulnerable to flooding due to its location near the marsh as well as its low elevation. Green roofs have multiple benefits that address both climate mitigation and adaptation:
Insulate buildings reducing heating and cooling needs and greenhouse gas emissions
Slow stormwater runoff and filter out pollutants
Reduce the urban heat island effect by cooling the air
Provide habitat for pollinators and other species.

In 2007, Salem State University anticipated these by adopting a goal of carbon neutrality by 2050. The most challenging aspect of meeting this goal is figuring out how to eliminate fossil fuels from heating and cooling. Salem State’s 2021 Clean Energy Feasibility Study for North Campus affirmed the role that geothermal energy must play in supporting this transition. 

Geothermal technology relies on the stable temperature of the ground at depth and uses that energy to heat or cool interior spaces. When the Library was built, Salem State was fortunate to be able to incorporate this technology into the building’s design.","Geothermal Energy is Poised for a Big Breakout (2020)

Winter Storm Grayson in January 2018 hit Massachusetts with hurricane-force wind gusts, 17 inches of snow in Boston, and a storm surge and high tide that reached 15.16 feet in Boston, flooding the financial district and the Aquarium T station.    As storms become more intense, communities must increasingly rely on a combination of defenses, including floodgates, to protect vulnerable areas. Salem State University has been fortunate to be protected by the City of Salem’s flood prevention infrastructure. However, as climate changes escalate, such structures need to be maintained, upgraded, and expanded to areas lacking such protections, at great cost.

Green roofs remove heat from the air and reduce temperatures of the roof surface and surrounding air, moderating the heat island effect particularly during the day. For its garage, Hampton Inn constructed a green roof rather than a 3rd floor of parking. In addition to creating rooms with a view, the green roof cools the hotel, removing heat from the air through the process of evapotranspiration. Green roof temperatures can be 30–40°F lower than those of conventional roofs and act as insulators to reduce building energy use by 0.7% compared to conventional roofs.  Green roofs also filter pollutants from rainfall and their vegetation can remove pollutants and GHGs from the air through dry deposition and carbon sequestration and storage, respectively. Importantly for Salem, the Hampton Inn green roof reduces and delays stormwater runoff in the South River flood zone.","EPA, Using Green Roofs to Reduce Heat Islands

The destructive power of storm surge and large battering waves is often the greatest threat to life and property during a storm, and can result in loss of life, destroyed buildings, beach and dune erosion, and road and bridge damage along the coast (1). The continual rise in sea level has provided a higher base on which storm surge accumulates and tropical storms became slower-moving, which resulted in rain, wind, and storm surge persisting over multiple tidal cycles, thus causing more damage. In addition to tropical storms and hurricanes, nor’easters are intense storms that develop from low pressure centers that derive their energy from the strong temperature gradients that commonly occur just off the U.S. East Coast during winter. They move along the coast of Massachusetts with wind blowing across the Atlantic Ocean from the northeast, directly onto the shore (2).
