1,newburyport,,2018,MAR 2,UNDER WATER ,3,3,Storm surge floods American Yacht Club and erodes shoreline up to Wastewater Treatment Plant. ,,"Flooding the area in a single tidal cycle, a winter storm caused the highest tide since the weather service began recording in 1921 (1). With increased tidal levels and extreme weather due to climate change, flooding began to occur more frequently in coastal towns such as Newburyport (2). When astronomical high tides coincide with multi-day storm events, oceanic storm surge causes sea level to rise above the river which, consequently, prevents the river from discharging. As sea levels continued to rise throughout the 21st century, the risk of inundation continued to increase.","(1) Ferris, Robert. “Boston floods and records highest tide in nearly 100 years in wake of snowstorm.” CNBC (5 January 2018). https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/05/boston-floods-and-records-highest-tide-in-nearly-100-years-in-wake-of-snowstorm.html <br><br> (2) Newburyport’s FEMA Hazard Mitigation Plan.

2,newburyport,,2021,JUN 9,FACILITY PROTECTED,2,2,"Built against rising sea levels, this revetment made the Rail Trail possible and protects Wastewater Treatment Plant. ",,"In response to storm surge damage to the shore, plans were made to elevate the shoreline to keep flood waters from reaching the Wastewater Treatment Plant. With sea levels continuing to rise, the revetment only delayed when the city would need to relocate the plant to higher ground for a permanent solution (1). A significant benefit to the community was that the revetment construction enabled repair of the longstanding riverfront gap in the city’s Rail Trail.

Across much of the country, advances in spring thaw have exceeded delay in fall freeze. In the Northeast, where winters have been warming three times as fast as summers, the season of activity for insects has extended. Mosquitoes, ticks, and other pests are less active in cooler weather, but without a hard frost their populations stopped declining over winter (1). As a result, human interaction with the diseases these pests carry increased (2).","(1) Rawlins, M., Bradley, R., Diaz, H., Kimball, J., Robinson, D.
