									<p class='about-body'>Salt marshes provide important habitat for wildlife and offer numerous benefits for people, 
										too, such as storing flood water and absorbing wave energy during storms. In Durham, there are roughly 150 acres 
										of existing salt marsh. Unfortunately, these important ecosystems are threatened by rising seas. In coastal NH, 
										sea-level is likely to rise between 0.5 - 1.3 feet by 2050 and between 1.0 - 2.9 feet by 2100 if global greenhouse 
										gas concentrations stabilize; however, there is a risk of much greater sea-level rise if global greenhouse gas 
										concentrations continue to grow and the rate of ice mass loss from Antarctica accelerates rapidly (1). As sea levels 
										rise, salt marshes will migrate upland if they can, or they'll be lost if they don't have room to move. In some cases, 
										the topography is too steep to allow gradual salt marsh migration. In other cases, there is a barrier to migration, 
										such as a road, undersized culvert, or retaining wall that causes the marsh to get 'squeezed out'. According to 
										marsh migration models, opportunities for salt marsh migration in Durham include areas adjacent to the Oyster River 
										and Little Bay. Durham, in conjunction with the NH Department of Transportation, is incorporating these projections 
										into the design of the Route 4 bridge replacement to allow salt marsh habitat to persist in the face of rising seas, 
										maintaining the many benefits these ecosystems provide and helping to prevent future flooding issues.

								<p class='about-body'>The Paris Climate Accord of 2015 was a remarkable achievement but it made clear the limit of greenhouse 
									gas reduction to which nations were committed. The withdrawal of the United States further indicated 
									that there would be limits to commitment itself. In contrast, however, there was from the beginning, 
									robust attention to climate change at the local level. Even before Paris, the Town of Durham had 
									begun developing
									<a href="https://www.ci.durham.nh.us/administration/responding-climate-change">plans to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.</a>
								</p>
								<p class='about-body'>It had become clear that if nations simply achieved the Paris goals this risked being too little too late. 
									With no expectation of further national intervention, and understanding that all climate change effects 
									would be local, the town projected the effects into the future and planned projects to deal with them. 
									Because public demand for energy and other carbon-producing processes ultimately drove GHG emissions, 
									the town hoped to engage the public in a bottom-up action to reduce demand more quickly. Significantly 
									reducing emissions and the effects of climate change would depend on the participation of all residents. 
									The Seacoast Remembrance Project traces significant milestones in climate change and the fight against its 
									effects on the town.
								</p>

								<p class='about-body'>The Seacoast Remembrance Project is a public art installation that connects viewers to the 
									challenges communities face from climate change and the ongoing local efforts to address them. Drawing from climate 
									science projections, the project employs the concept of time travel to bring the enormous scale of climate change 
									down to the intimate scale of our lives.
