Along the salt marsh, Phragmites invades the edges where it has access to freshwater seepage, which allows it to grow and outcompete native salt marsh plants. While Phragmites can tolerate some salinity, it cannot withstand frequent saltwater inundation. Restoring tidal flow where it is restricted is a restoration technique commonly used to control Phragmites.
