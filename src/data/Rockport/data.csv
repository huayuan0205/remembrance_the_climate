1,Rockport,,2046,JUL  24,PALETTES DULLED,ROCKPORT-2,2,Dust from wildfires mutes observable colors; sunrises and sunsets dominate 125th anniversary exhibition.,,"Plein air painters have long sought brilliant light and its effect on color, whether in the south of France (1) or north shore of Essex County. A celebrated list of great American artists were drawn to the open expanse of the coast where light not blocked by trees or buildings is further intensified by reflection off the sea. To this the Great Marsh adds a sea of green that unfolds under bright blue skies. But due to smoke from increasing west coast wildfires, blue sky was no longer visible to Cape Ann painters as midday colors were masked by haze. However, the additional smoke particles in the atmosphere accentuated long wavelength colors — the reds, yellows and oranges of sunset (2).","(1) https://www.fondation-vincentvangogh-arles.org/en/documentation-2/vincent-van-gogh/van-gogh-et-la-lumiere-provencale/

2,Rockport,,2057,AUG,LANDMARK SAVED,ROCKPORT-1,1,"Threatened by rising sea level and increasingly violent storm surge, Motif #1 relocated inland.",,"Originally an unpainted structure of grey weathered wood, Motif #1 was depicted by many artists in color, most often red. Its true appearance so surprised visitors to Rockport that the Rockport Art Association decided to paint it. Long time president Aldro Hibbard formulated the hue – a red that looked weathered even when first applied – by adding crankcase oil to the paint. 40 RAA artists helped to painted it, at first only on sides facing town. Even though it was in a well-protected harbor, the building was destroyed in the Blizzard of 1978 (1) and an exact replica was built by the town. With sea levels rising and storm surges increasing in intensity (2), it became clear that nothing short of relocation would prevent a repeat of this fate.","(1) http://archive.boston.com/news/weather/gallery/013108_78blizzard?pg=8
